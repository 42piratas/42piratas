## Hey! √ÇndersonQ here üëã‚Äç

I have been proudly helping to build the [Decentralized Internet](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/about/manifesto/) and a [better home of mind](https://www.eff.org/cyberspace-independence) at the [AKASHA Foundation](https://akasha.org/).

Check [AKASHA.org](https://akasha.org/), [AKASHA.world](https://akasha.world/), [AKASHA Hub Barcelona](https://akasha.org/hub-bcn/) and [Ethereum World](https://ethereum.world/).

I believe in [global citizenship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_citizenship), [information open access](https://archive.org/stream/GuerillaOpenAccessManifesto/Goamjuly2008_djvu.txt), and [free-culture](https://freeculture.org/Free_Culture_Manifesto); and I love to experiment with social collaboration and governance models.

And I'm always up to grab a coffee (or rum) to talk about anything, from game theory, data science, blockchains, and chess to graphic novels, videogames, punk rock, and Takashi Miike's films - so feel free to drop me a line at a[at]42p[dot]me - 4ABF CEB7 6E1C 0874 5E4F AA6D 5D7B 3B05 E5DC 5F40
